  <h2>Welcome to my portfolio site! </h2> 
    <h3>
      My name is Sage and I'm a current student at DePaul.  
      I'm studying Geography with a concentration in GIS & Geotechnology. 
      I enjoy the technical side of my major, but I've always been an artist at heart, which
      is why I've chosen to pursue a minor in Graphic Design. 
      My minor and my creative side has meshed well with my Geography major especially
      when it comes to data visualization and presenting important information. This portfolio
      website is a combination of a personal project in learning and practicing html 
      while simultaneously displaying the various projects I've worked on.
      Feel free to explore my website to learn more about how I've been
      applying my skills, experience, and the things I've been learning! </h3>
