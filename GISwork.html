  <h2>Research on Green-Space in Chicago</h2>
  <img src="images/parkchicago.jpg" alt="Ping Tom Memorial Park Chinatown">
  <p>There is no question that the physical environment around us has a tremendous impact on our mental
    well being. 'Green space' is a part of this physical environment within a community or neighborhood, and
    it can refer to features such as parks, gardens, vegetation, and tree canopy. Unequal distribution of such
    green spaces, as well as the unequal accessibility and quality, correlate to unequal mental and social
    health of various neighborhoods and larger communities... <a href=files/geo103final.pdf target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" > Click to read more -> </a></p>

      The city core and the fortress which stands within it is the focal point from which the rest of Surat expands outwards. 
      From village and street names, the semi circular roads that define the urban shape, the bazaars and economic culture, 
      its industry and exports, to the organic town plan of the inner city, Suratâ€™s history is still alive. The culture and 
      community has withstood the impacts and pressure of colonialism, globalization, and rapid urbanization, 
      just as the walls and fortress once defended the flourishing port city...
